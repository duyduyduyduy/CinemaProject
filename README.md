# CINEMA BOOKING PROJECT

## Introduction

<img src="./Img/HomePage.png">

My project was built by ReactJs and aimed to allow users book cinema ticket. There are 2 two flows of booking:

- The first one is to let users select movie first and select cinema afterward
- The other one is opposite: the users choose cinema first and then select movie.
